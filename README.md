# ARKit-iOSCamera-Swap

App initializes in ARKit with a forward facing view with the backCameraWide with a button that when pressed turns off ARKit and 
initializes the forward-facing camera. ARFaceTrackingConfiguration only works with iPhone 10, so this is important functionality 
for all earlier iphones who want to transition between AR collaboration with a forward facing subject, and simple video-calling 
(perhaps with Twilio integration).
